## Questionnaire

### Speech
> I create models from data and bring them to life in software environment

### My Tick

1. What work activities start my tick?
> I get excited playing with various datasets, come up with business objective questions and finding necessary evidence to solve them. It feels like the detective work from Sci-fi movie. When I feel 

### My Past

1. In what way(s) did your past career choices make sense? In what way(s) do they appear to not make sense? Are there any patterns?
> As the first engineer coming from a family of doctors, I always wanted to help doctors get around the ambiguity caused by the patients condition. Being an undergrad student, who's specifically good at Mathematics, Coding, Statistical Analysis and Critical Thinking, I started working on my share of research on medical imaging and participated in various Computer Vision projects that helped enhance the quality of the diagnosis. This got interested in the world of AI and Robotics. I pursued my passion on learning different aspects of AI and even achieved a masters degree in AI and Robotics. 

2. What was missing from your previous job(s) that you enjoy now and How do you use your undergraduate studies in your work life??
> As a undergrad student, I have explored various career possibilities and interned as cybersecurity analyist, graphic designer and web developer to find what I was passionate about. Through the journey, I have found interest in all of them, as all these roles demand skills like coding and critical thinking. But there is one thing in AI which I was phenomenal at, which is at mathematics and statistics which I have discovered it through practical application of AI. This got me passionate about AI. One other major factor that I felt amazed about AI is, it's utilization ability in any sector. My knowledge on Coding, Statistical Analysis and Critical Thinking is applied on daily basis in the creation, optimization, encapsulation and deployment of various AI models in a software codebase.

3. What are you looking for a role?
> I always wanted to see my work make a difference to the society and working with data science and AI felt that I'm getting it.

### Unique-ness

1. I'm best known for my technical knowledge and organization skills amongst my coworkers.

2. I’m the go-to person for all things related to the practical implementation of data science on my team. 

3. I got promoted to a managerial data scientist and software engineer in the six months of my employment at the company.

4. My friends would describe me as a computer nerd, attentive listener, organizer and foodie.

5. You wouldn’t be able to detect that I’m realist in an interview, but if we worked together on a project for three months, it’d be clear. (Not a pragmatist)

6. What is my most unique quality?
> 
#### WIP

- The greatest compliment I ever got at work was "Legend of Optimization" since I have planned the development life cycle of Optimization Module that involved my work in researching about the algorithms, performing system designing, integrating the modules and handling the deployment procedure.

- A Spender learning to perfect personal finance

- Why do you have interest in different fields?

> In the journey of finding my passion in computer science, I chose AI and Robotics in which I worked on Behavioural and Cognitive Robotics that got 
> and got my interest in quantum physics. 

- I studied AI and robotics in the search for this behavioral and cognitive information
