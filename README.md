* Hello, I'm Amar Sai Teja C.

* As the first engineer from a family of doctors, it has always been 


I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic computer science graduate, passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Robotics. 
I am a visual learner.
I have worked in the roles of software developer and designer, and worked on projects based on Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Application Development. 
I am also interested in new emerging technologies like quantum computing and block chain, and have knowledge on software implementation on the concept.

## Profile

A data-driven Data Scientist with a year of industrial experience in IT Research and Development on 
handling and managing the overall development cycle of the proposed modules. 
Equipped with ability to work with AWS ECR for Continuous Integration and Deployment, Data Science 
frameworks in Python & R for Product Development & Pattern Recognition, PowerBI for designing Reports and Dashboards.

## Questions I asked myself

### My Past

1. In what way(s) did your past career choices make sense? In what way(s) do they appear to not make sense? Are there any patterns?
As the first engineer coming from a family of doctors, I always wanted to help doctors get around the ambiguity caused by the patients condition. Being an undergrad student, who's specifically good at Mathematics, Coding, Statistical Analysis and Critical Thinking, I started working on my share of research on medical imaging and participated in various Computer Vision projects that helped enhance the quality of the diagnosis. This got interested in the world of AI and Robotics. I pursued my passion on learning different aspects of AI and even achieved a masters degree in AI and Robotics. 

2. What was missing from your previous job(s) that you enjoy now and How do you use your undergraduate studies in your work life??
As a undergrad student, I have explored various career possibilities and interned as cybersecurity analyist, graphic designer and web developer to find what I was passionate about. I found interest in all of them as all these roles demanded the skills like coding and critical thinking. But there is one thing in AI which I was phenomenal at, which is doing mathematics and statistics, I found out these are practically applied in AI. This got me passionate about AI. One other major fact that amazed me about AI is that, it could be used in any sector. My knowledge on Coding, Statistical Analysis and Critical Thinking is applied on daily basis in the creation, optimization, encapsulation and deployment of various AI models in a software codebase.

### Success

3. The greatest compliment I ever got at work was "Legend of Optimization" since I have planned the development life cycle of Optimization Module that involved my work in researching about the algorithms, performing system designing, integrating the modules and handling the deployment procedure.

4. I’m best known for my technical knowledge and planning amongst my coworkers.

5. I’m the go-to person for all things related to the practical implementation of data science on my team. 

6. I have promoted to the lead data scientist and software engineer in a 6 months of my employment.

7. My friends would describe me as a computer nerd, foodie, philospher and organizer.

8. You wouldn’t be able to detect that I’m realist in an interview, but if we worked together on a project for three months, it’d be clear.
